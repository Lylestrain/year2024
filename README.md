## Creating a new line
creating a new line with **2 spaces** at end of line  
Here is another new line created with 2 spaces addeed to the end of the previous line.

Another way to start a new line is to leave

a blank line between sentences.  
It looks more like the start of a new paragraph

_however_.

The (*) multiply sign or the(_) underscore can be used to **bold** __text__ or *italicize* text.  
___bold&italicized___ is achieved by using either 3 times on either side of text.

### The (#)pound sign
The pound sign is for headings like CSS, up to level 6.
